This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
For a quick setup that will get you up and running locally on your computer:

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/DataSciGeek/balance-usage-system
```

You need to configure the evironment variables. 
Visit [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) and create a project to generate the API keys required 
to run the application. Let the name of the table be `users`

Run the following command assuming you have already configured your Airtable API's.
##### Unix based systems:
```
cp .env.template .env.local
```
##### Window computers:
```
copy .env.template .env.local
```
Update the values in the template with your Airtable API keys

# To run the application
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
